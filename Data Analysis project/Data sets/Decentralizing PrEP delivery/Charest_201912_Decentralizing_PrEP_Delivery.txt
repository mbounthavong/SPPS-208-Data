DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. File List: DPD_Patient_Baseline.csv, DPD_Patient_FollowUp.csv

These two datasets come from an implementation and dissemination study that explored the decentralization of PrEP delivery from specialist physicians to family physicians and public health nurses. Potential patients received an information card about PrEP which led them to an online module on how to engage a provider about PrEP. After completing the module, potential participants were offered to take part in the study, which asked them to complete a baseline questionnaire and follow-up questionnaire six months later. The questionnaires included demographic questions, questions about substance use and sexual behaviours, questions about PrEP and the study, as well as questions about participants' relationship with their primary care providers. 

2. Relationship between files, if important: The first file contains the data from the participants' baseline questionnaire while the second file contains the data from participants' 6-month follow-up questionnaire. 


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection of data: The methods for data collection can be found in the following articles: Sharma M, Chris A, Chan A, et al. Decentralizing the delivery of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) through family physicians and sexual health clinic nurses: a dissemination and implementation study protocol. BMC Health Serv Res;18:513. doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3324-2; Charest M, Sharma M, Chris A, et al. Decentralizing PrEP delivery: Implementation and dissemination strategies to increase PrEP uptake in Toronto, Canada. PLOS ONE;in press. 

2. Methods for processing the data: Data were collected via an online survey platform. Participants who did not consent to the study or did not complete the questionnaire were removed from the dataset. Missing data were left as is and assigned a value of -99, which was an impossible value in our dataset. Participants' answers were initially textual (e.g., very satisfied) and were assigned numeric values which are described below.
