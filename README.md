# Background
This page contains course materials for UCSD SSPPS Study Design and Biostatistics course series (SPPS 206 and SPPS 208).

# Research Plan project (Fall Quarter)
Students will work in teams of 5 to 6 to develop a hypothetical research plan using the tools and skills from class. 

The research plan template is located in the following [link](https://github.com/mbounthavong/UCSD-Study-Design-and-Biostatistics/raw/refs/heads/main/Research%20Plan%20project/Research%20Plan%20Report%20Template/UCSD-Biomedical-Non-Intervention-Protocol-Template-12.08.21.docx). You can use this to help construct your research plan. It's the template that UCSD uses for IRB submission. 


# Data analysis project (Winter Quarter)
Students will work in the same team as their Research Plan/Protocol project. 

Data for the data analysis project are located in the [Data sets folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/UCSD-Study-Design-and-Biostatistics/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20project/Data%20sets).

Each data set has been used in peer reviewed publications. You can read the associated publications, which have been saved in the [Papers folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/UCSD-Study-Design-and-Biostatistics/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20project/Papers). 

Each data set has a research question that teams will need to answer. The list of questions is located in the following [folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/UCSD-Study-Design-and-Biostatistics/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20project/Research%20questions%20for%20data%20sets). 

I uploaded a [template](https://github.com/mbounthavong/UCSD-Study-Design-and-Biostatistics/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20project/Presentation%20template) for teams to use in their final data analysis project. It contains relevant slides that should be included in the final presentation. Although this template has been provided for students to use, I encourage teams to leverage their creativity and use their own template design. 

The 5-page report template is also availble in the following [folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/UCSD-Study-Design-and-Biostatistics/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20project/Report%20template). 


# R code for the course (Fall and Winter)
